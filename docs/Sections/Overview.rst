PAS MODEL OVERVIEW
=====================================


What is it
-------------------------------------
This model of the PIXEL platform aims elucidate the required activities in port to handle cargo between vessels and yard.

Firstly, the model build the Port's Activities Scenario (PAS). For each of the activities, the scenario precise **what** are the resouces used, **when** does it occur they occur and **where** in the port.

Secondly, from the PAS can be calcul outcomes, likes **energy consumption**, **pollutant emission**, or **area occupancy**. From these primary metrics, secondary metrics could be derived, such as utilization rate, energy efficiency, or the existence of bottlenecks.

How to use it
-------------------------------------
Considering three :ref:`inputs`, a list of vessel-calls to handle, a set of port's parameters and several options, the model aims to establish the required activities in port, among other :ref:`outputs`.
