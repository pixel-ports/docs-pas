A vessel-call can contains distinct cargo unloading and loading. Each will be decompose by the PAS model as \"handling\". As an example, if a vessel-call point to unload X tons of cargo A and load Y tons of cargo B, it will be converted to 2 handlings. The first handling correspond to unload X tons of cargo A, the second handling correspond to load Y tons of cargo B, both can have distinct vessel docking area. Overview Inside a \"data\" field, a vessel-call document contains the fallowing fields: Name Required Relate to Illustrative value(s) name No Vessel \"Titanic\" IMO No Vessel 1131428 journeyid No Vessel \"2021072015423tit\" (un)loading_bert Yes Docking dock_42 arrival_dock Yes Docking 1626776488 (epoch second), 1626776488000 (epoch millisecond), \"1921-07-20T10:23:02\" (ISO 8601) departure_dock Yes Docking 1626776488 (epoch second), 1626776488000 (epoch millisecond), \"1921-07-20T10:23:02\" (ISO 8601) (un)loading_cargo_type Yes Content \"corn\", \"cars\", \"chopped wood\" (un)loading_cargo_fiscal_type No Content \"cereal\" (un)loading_dangerous Yes Content true, false (un)loading_tonnage Yes Content 31415 NB 1: (un)loading_ can figure both loading_ or unloading_ NB 2: for arrival_dock and departure_dock, see corresponding option in Settings Currently the PAS model focuses on the loading and unloading of ships. But it is possible to extend it to the loading and unloading of other vehicles such as trucks, river barges or trains, even to monitor transfer of goods between storage areas. The current format of the vessel call data is inherited from the first port that provided data. This format is peculiar in that it mixes various information in an arbitrary manner. To make the PAS model work on raw data in a different format, a port can incorporate into the PAS model a vessel-call conversion module (from its own raw format to the format expected by the PA model). IH and GUI Each vessel-calls are stored as distinct documents in Information Hub. To run the PAS model, the index containing vessel-calls have to be provided (usually \"arh-lts-vesselcall\"). Filtering on date All VCs in this index will be use, except if dates are provided for filtering purpose. Then the VCs would be filtered to restrict to the one present inside the port after a starting date and/or before an end date. The date format is ISO 8601. The OT provides a GUI for this purpose, as show in figure X The OT GUI for VCs filtering on date (with optional automatic date identification) Passing VCs in forceinput When using forceinput for vessel-call data, the fallowing structure have to be respected: { \"forceinput\": [ { \"name\": \"vessel_call\", \"value\": [ { \"data\": { ...(first vessel-call)... } }, { \"data\": { ...(second vessel-call)... } } ] } ] } Port's parameters The port's parameters describes resources (machines, areas, content-types, energies, pollutants), process (supply-chains, timetables) and their assignation to vessel-calls. Overview An extensive description can be found in the corresponding json-schema (with details for each field, such as textual description, allowed type and example values). From PAS model point of view, required items are Machines, Areas, Supply-chains and Content-types. Optional items are Time-table, Pollutants and Energies. However, in the graphical interface from the dashboard, to create some required items, optional items may have to be created previously. Thus when created from the graphical interface, all items can be considered as required (even with empty values). The port's parameter Name Required Use Main sub-fields Time tables No Assign working hours to resources For each day of the week, start and end of working hours Pollutants No Extend the default pollutants tracked if additional data regarding them can be provide in other entries (such custom emission factors for machines). Furthermore, the alert threshold allows to identify over-emission situation. Note possible partial overlap with default preset for PEI calculation General description, Alert threshold Energies Yes Track energy use in port.

For each, a set of rules to associate it with the proper supply-chain. The assignation rules can also involve direction, docking area or amount of cargo General description and list suitable supply-chains (with corresponding sub-rules) IH and GUI The whole set is stored as an unique document in the Information Hub. The localization of the document (index & doc_id), or a forced value, is required to run the PAS model. An interface is proposed to edit the port's parameters (\"PAS information\" in the navigation panel, see figure X). The graphical interface to edit port's parameters. This interface exports the created document in an index designed by user (default pas_inputs_port_parameter ), with a random doc_id. This doc_id must be specified to run the model. The graphical interface allows to export port's parameters into IH to a designed index (but to a random doc_id) Settings Overview PAS model have options that can be turn on or off (e.g. delay handling if overload a specific type of resource) or customized (e.g. time resolution for scheduling or outcomes calculation). This is set through the settings document. Each module have its entry on this document. The most remarkable are listed below. Pipeline This global setting list the sequence of modules that will be run. Turning off some module can speed up the running time, and lower required inputs. Such deep control on PAS model behavior require good understanding of the PAS model internal functioning.

Indeed, depending of the port IT infrastructure, VCs may have different format for arrival_dock and departur_dock , the proper one have to be specified here. The PAS model can handle 3 formats : TS_format value Suitable for epoch_second 1620097321 or \"1620097321\" epoch_miliseconde 1620097321123 or \"1620097321123\" iso8601 \"2021-05-04T03:02:01.00\" or \"2021-05-04T03:02:01.00Z\" or \"2021-05-04T03:02:01.00 +02:00\" (or several similar string) filters The tolerance level of the filter of the handlings designated as \"aberrant\" can be modulated through the content of the field filter .

But this is refined with sub-rules. Here those sub-rules can be globally dis-activated. Handling delayer \"handling_delayer\": { \"time_resolution\": 15, \"constraints_activation\": { \"areas capacity\": true, \"machines availability\": true } } time_resolution The time duration in minutes that is used to discretize the time dimension during scheduling process constraints_activation When an activity to process an handling requires more resources than available at that time, the activity is identified with the status \"overloading\". Handling with activity overloading can be re-scheduled to avoid any overloading. Currently, two constraint are available.

Illustration of the basic operating principle of the PAS Firstly, the model build the Port's Activities Scenario (PAS). This mean to elucidate the required activities in port to handle cargoes in port (e.g. unload from vessel to warehouse storage). For each of the activities, the scenario precise what are the goods, when does it occurs and how (resources and process used). The purpose of the PAS is to identify and schedule the activities required in the port to process cargoes Secondly, from the PAS can be calculate outcomes, likes energy consumption , pollutant emission , or area occupancy . From these primary metrics, secondary metrics could be derived, such as utilization rate, energy efficiency, or the existence of bottlenecks. Why: PAS uses Considering a list of vessel-calls to handle, a set of port's parameters and several options ( see Inputs section ), the model aims to establish the required activities in port (among other see Outputs section ). Depending on the type of data provided as input, four use can be proposed, as show in table X Input data Use case Live stream (e.g. IoT) Monitoring Consolidated historical (e.g. invoices & registers) Assessment Estimated future (e.g. predictive algorithms) Forecast \u00ab What if \u00bb scenario (e.g. change a machine, traffic evolution) Explore How: run the PAS model Localy The model can be use by itself, considering it receive a proper model_instance ( see section OT call to the PAS model ). But is mean to be deployed in PIXEL platform thought a Docker image. From python (requirements available in ./pipfile ): PAS_model.py --from_file \"path/to/pas_instance.json\" From docker: docker build -t pas_model -f ./DOCKERISE/Dockerfile . docker run pas_model python3 PAS_model.py {mode_instance} On pixel platform The present section focus on the Operational Tools interface that need to be fulfilled in order to execute the PAS model. Through a json named model instance, the Operational Tool pass to the PAS model informations to retrieve its inputs and export its outputs ( see OT documentation ). The OT interface to execute the PAS In the Input section, the user provides localization of the inputs in the Information Hub. That is to say an index and a document id. Default values are preset, but to use them, user have to actually store the input in those locations. In the Output section, the user provide localization where the PAS model will export its results in the Information Hub. That is to say an index and a document id.

Illustration of the basic operating principle of the PAS Firstly, the model build the Port's Activities Scenario (PAS). This mean to elucidate the required activities in port to handle cargoes in port (e.g. unload from vessel to warehouse storage). For each of the activities, the scenario precise what are the goods, when does it occurs and how (resources and process used). The purpose of the PAS is to identify and schedule the activities required in the port to process cargoes Secondly, from the PAS can be calculate outcomes, likes energy consumption , pollutant emission , or area occupancy . From these primary metrics, secondary metrics could be derived, such as utilization rate, energy efficiency, or the existence of bottlenecks.","title":"What : PAS concept"},{"location":"overview/overview/#why-pas-uses","text":"Considering a list of vessel-calls to handle, a set of port's parameters and several options ( see Inputs section ), the model aims to establish the required activities in port (among other see Outputs section ).
